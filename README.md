# IPL-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) to extract meaningful insights and trends. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, various aspects of IPL matches and deliveries were explored, such as team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes. The insights derived can help better understand the dynamics of the game.

# Datasets Used
1. matches.csv
   This dataset contains detailed information about IPL matches, including match dates, venues, teams, results, and more.

2. deliveries.csv
   This dataset provides ball-by-ball details of IPL matches, including batsman and bowler performance, runs scored, wickets taken, and extras conceded.

# Files in the Repository
1. IPL_analysis.ipynb
   The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis performed on the IPL datasets. This file includes data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results.
2. matches.csv
3. deliveries.csv

# Analysis Highlights
 1.Comprehensive visualization of match results and performance trends.
 2.Player-level statistics for batsmen and bowlers.
 3.Team-level analysis, including win percentages and key performers.
 4.Insights into season-wise performance and patterns.
